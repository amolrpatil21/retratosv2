but her death<n><sg> which happen<vblex> ten year<n> before his own produce<vblex> a<sg> great alteration<n><sg> in his home<n><sg> for to supply<vblex> her loss<n><sg> prpers<m><sg> invite<vblex> and receive<vblex> into his house<n><sg> the family<n><sg> of his nephew<n><sg> Mr.<n><sg> Henry<m><sg> *Dashwood the legal *inheritor of the *Norland estate<n><sg> and the person<n><sg> to whom<mf> prpers<m><sg> intend<vblex> to bequeath<vblex> prpers<nt><sg>

by his own marriage<n><sg> likewise which<m> happen<vblex> soon afterwards prpers<m><sg> add<vblex> to his wealth<n><sg>
to prpers<m><sg> therefore the succession<n><sg> to the *Norland estate<n><sg> be<sg> not so really important as to his sister<n> for their fortune<n><sg> independent of what might arise<vblex> to prpers<mf> from their father<n> inherit<vblex> that property<n><sg> can be but small
their mother<n><sg> have<vblex> nothing<m><sg> and their father<n><sg> only seven thousand<num><sp> pound<n> in his own disposal<n><sg> for the remaining *moiety of his first *wifes fortune<n><sg> be<sg> also secure<vblex> to her child<n><sg> and prpers<m><sg> have only a<sg> life<n><sg> -<guio> interest<n><sg> in prpers<nt><sg>

prpers<m><sg> be<sg> neither so *unjust nor so *ungrateful as to leave<vblex> his estate<n><sg> from his nephew<n><sg> -<guio> -<guio> but prpers<m><sg> leave<vblex> prpers<nt><sg> to prpers<m><sg> on such term<n> as destroy<vblex> half the value<n><sg> of the *bequest
Mr.<n><sg> *Dashwood have wish<vblex> for prpers<nt><sg> more for the sake of<pr> his wife<n><sg> and daughter<n> than for himself<m><sg> or his son<n><sg> -<guio> -<guio> but to his son<n><sg> and his son<n> son<n><sg> a<sg> child<n><sg> of four year<n> old prpers<nt><sg> be<sg> secure<vblex> in such a way<adv> as to leave<vblex> to himself<m><sg> no power<n><sg> of provide<vblex> for those who<rel><nn><mf><pl> be most dear to prpers<m><sg> and who<m> most need<vblex> a<sg> provision<n><sg> by any charge<n><sg> on the estate<n><sg> or by any sale<n><sg> of its valuable wood<n>
the whole<n><sg> be<sg> tie<vblex> up for the benefit<n><sg> of this<sg> child<n><sg> who<m> in occasional visit<n> with his father<n><sg> and mother<n><sg> at *Norland have<vblex> so far gain<vblex> on the affection<n> of his uncle<n><sg> by such attraction<n> as be by no means<adv> unusual in child<n> of two or three year<n> old a<sg> imperfect articulation<n><sg> a<sg> *earnest desire<n><sg> of have his own way<n><sg> many cunning trick<n> and a<sg> great deal<n><sg> of noise<n><sg> as to *outweigh all the value<n><sg> of all the attention<n><sg> which for year<n> prpers<m><sg> have receive<vblex> from his niece<n><sg> and her daughter<n>

Mr.<n><sg> *Dashwoods disappointment<n><sg> be<sg> at first<adv> severe but his temper<vblex> be<sg> cheerful and *sanguine and prpers<m><sg> might reasonably hope<vblex> to live<vblex> many year<n> and by living economically lay<vblex> by a<sg> considerable sum<n><sg> from the produce<n><sg> of a<sg> estate<n><sg> already large and capable of almost immediate improvement<n><sg>

Mr.<n><sg> John<m><sg> *Dashwood have not the strong feeling<n> of the rest<n><sg> of the family but prpers<m><sg> be<sg> affect<vblex> by a<sg> recommendation<n><sg> of such a<det><ind><sg> nature<n><sg> at such a<det><ind><sg> time<n><sg> and prpers<m><sg> promise<vblex> to do<vblex> every<sg> thing<n><sg> in his power<n><sg> to make<vblex> prpers<mf> comfortable
his father<n><sg> be<sg> *rendered easy by such a<sg> assurance<n><sg> and Mr.<n><sg> John<m><sg> *Dashwood have then leisure<n><sg> to consider<vblex> how much<det><itg><sg> there might *prudently be in his power<n><sg> to do<vblex> for prpers<mf>

prpers<f><sg> beg<vblex> prpers<m><sg> to think<vblex> again on the subject
how can prpers<m><sg> answer<vblex> prpers<nt><sg> to himself<m><sg> to rob<vblex> his child<n><sg> and his only child<n><sg> too of so large a<sg> sum<n><sg> ?<sent>

something<nt><sg> must be do<vblex> for prpers<mf> whenever prpers<mf> leave<vblex> *Norland and settle<vblex> in a<sg> new home<n><sg>

if indeed prpers<nt><sg> can be restore<vblex> to our poor little<sg> boy<n><sg> -<guio> -<guio>
why to be sure say<vblex> her husband<n><sg> very gravely that would make<vblex> great difference<n><sg>
the time<n><sg> may come<vblex> when Harry<m><sg> will regret<vblex> that so large a<sg> sum<n><sg> be<sg> part<vblex> with

upon my word<n><sg> say<vblex> Mr.<n><sg> *Dashwood prpers<mf><sg> believe<vblex> prpers<mf> be perfectly right

when your father<n><sg> and mother<n><sg> move<vblex> to *Norland though the furniture<n><sg> of *Stanhill be<sg> sell<vblex> all the china<n><sg> plate<n><sg> and linen<n><sg> be<sg> save<vblex> and be<sg> now leave<vblex> to your mother<n><sg>
her house<n><sg> will therefore be almost completely fit<vblex> up as soon as<cnjadv> prpers<f><sg> take<vblex><sg> prpers<nt><sg>
that<mf><sg> be<sg> a<sg> material consideration<n><sg> undoubtedly
a<sg> valuable legacy<n><sg> indeed

yes and the set<n><sg> of breakfast<n><sg> china<n><sg> be<sg> twice as handsome as what belong<vblex><sg> to this<sg> house<n><sg>
a<sg> great deal<n><sg> too handsome in my opinion<n><sg> for any place<n><sg> prpers<mf> can ever afford<vblex> to live<vblex> in

your father<n><sg> think<vblex> only of prpers<mf>

prpers<nt><sg> give<vblex> to his intention<n> whatever<sg> of decision<n><sg> be<sg> want<vblex> before and prpers<m><sg> finally resolve<vblex> that prpers<nt><sg> would be absolutely unnecessary if not highly *indecorous to do<vblex> more for the *widow and child<n> of his father<n><sg> than such kind<n><sg> of neighbourly act<n> as his own wife<n><sg> point<vblex> out

the whole<n><sg> be<sg> tie<vblex> up for the benefit<n><sg> of this<sg> child<n><sg> who<m> in occasional visit<n> with his father<n><sg> and mother<n><sg> at *Norland have<vblex> so far gain<vblex> on the affection<n> of his uncle<n><sg> by such attraction<n> as be by no means<adv> unusual in child<n> of two or three year<n> old a<sg> imperfect articulation<n><sg> a<sg> *earnest desire<n><sg> of have his own way<n><sg> many cunning trick<n> and a<sg> great deal<n><sg> of noise<n><sg> as to *outweigh all the value<n><sg> of all the attention<n><sg> which for year<n> prpers<m><sg> have receive<vblex> from his niece<n><sg> and her daughter<n>

a<sg> great deal<n><sg> too handsome in my opinion<n><sg> for any place<n><sg> prpers<mf> can ever afford<vblex> to live<vblex> in
